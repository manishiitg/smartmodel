#summary File Upload

= Introduction =
This tutorial details the steps for file uploading.

This require file as involved in upload the file.

*FileUtil.php*: Contains all the methods (_smartUpload,setUploadProperties_) neccessary for File upload.

*Example1:*This is an example of file upload using smartUpload method Which works only if form tag has attribute like as 

{{{<form action=””method=”post” enctype=”multipart/formdata”>}}}

{{{
$file=new FileModel();  
$fileutil=new FileUtil();
$fileutil->smartUpload($file,”folder path”);
}}}

In this example File Model is name of model for using smartModel and $file is an object of Model which has member variable called file 

which is same as input file.It assign filename to model  even to database.Folder name is full path where the file needs to be uploaded.

*Note* : In latest folder name you must include ‘/’ in end. 

*Example2:* This is an example for file upload using _setUploadProperties_ and _smartUpload_ method.


{{{
$file=new Filemodel(); 
$array[‘filename’]=array(‘required’=>’true’,’filter’=>’jpeg’,’folder’=>’admin/upload’,’unique’=>’true’,‘ sanitize’=>’true’,’fullpath’=>’true’);
$fileutil->setUploadProperties($array);
$fileutil->debug=true;
$fileutil->smartUpload($file,”folder path”);
if(isset($result['filename'][FileUtil::RESULT_ERROR]) && !empty($result['filename'][FileUtil::RESULT_ERROR])){
 echo $result['filename'][FileUtil::RESULT_ERROR];
 }(filename must be same as input type file name)

}}}

   And form design looks  like:
{{{
<form action=””  method=”post” enctype=”multipart/form-data”>
<input type=”file” name=”filename”/>
<input type=”submit”>
</form>
}}}

For successful file uploading it is neccessary to give enctype=”multipart/form-data”    in form start tag.So that file is moved to upload folder.

Here we defined an array containing attributes

_*required=>’true’:*_  If this is set true and $_FILES_  array doesn’t have file name in it then  it will generate error message otherwise it will not show any error.

_*filter=>’pdf’:*_ Here we define file extension type of the file being uploaded.We can define multiple file extensions  in array separated by commas like as Filter=>array(‘pdf’,’jpeg’,’mp3’).

_*Folder=>’admin/upload/’:*_ We define path name where we will upload the file.If we pass different folder names into method _smartUpload_ and _setUploadProperties_ 

then file will be moved into folder whose path is passed into _setUploadProperties_ method.

_*Unique=>’true’:*_ It will append unique id to each file name so that multiple files of same name in upload folder can be uploaded.

_*Sanitize=>’true’:*_ If this is set true then it will remove all white spaces ,brackets from filename.

_*Fullpath=>’true’:*_ In this case object will store fullpath of file name.

Now this array is passed into setUploadProperties method of FileUtil class.

*$fileutil->debug=true :* This echos any relevant output.If set false no message would be printed. 

*Note:* filename in $array[‘filename’] must have same name as in input type file name.

*_Results:_* As a result getResult method return an array is  returned which
shows which type of error comes if there is no error then it shows nothing.
