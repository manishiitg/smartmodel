#summary Defining a Model Class

= Introduction =

This tutorial will show how to define a Model Class and what all options are available.


== What is Model ==

Basic understanding of `<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller'>MVC</a>` is required to understand the concept of Model. Model is used to represent data, and in our case a Database Table. 

== The Model Class ==

The model class is used to represent a database table. 

Lets take an example of a database table for this tutorial

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users` (
  `id` bigint NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `username` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `usertype` integer unsigned NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `active` tinyint(1) NOT NULL,
  `block` boolean NOT NULL,
  `registration` date NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
);
