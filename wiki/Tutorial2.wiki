#summary Insert Function: saving a model to database

= The Insert Fuction OR SQL INSERT =

Here the test database table and model we had written in Tutorial1

{{{
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users` (
  `id` bigint NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `username` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `usertype` integer unsigned NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
);
}}}


{{{
class User extends SmartModel {
public $id;
public $username;
public $usertype;

public $_table = "users";
public $_fields = array('id','username','usertype');
}
}}}


Now to save this model to database is very easy, no SQL queries are required

{{{
$userObj = new User();
$userObj->username = 'Test';
$userObj->usertype = 1;
$id = $userObj->insert();
}}}

*SQL Output* (SQLTracking is assumed to be true in all tutorials)

Query Exec: INSERT INTO `users`(`username`,`usertype`) VALUES ('Test','1')


As you can see, the model got saved in the database. No need to write any sql query.

{{{
$id = $userObj->insert();
}}}

$id contains the insert id of the row.
