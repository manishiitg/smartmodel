#summary Creating your own UI Style.

= Introduction =

This tutorial details the steps of creating a new style for the UI model.

This requires the files from *SmartModel*.

The files directly related to this tutorial are:

    * *UI.php*: the main UI class.
    * *ModelStyles.php*: contains the *ModelStyles* interface. 

=Implementing a new UI Style class:=
Creating a new style starts with implementing a new class for the ModelStyles interface. This interface contains all function prototypes that are required to implement a new style.

*Note: All functions from the interface needs to be implemented in the class for the new style.*

The syntax for class definition is
{{{
class New_Style implements ModelStyles{

// All function definitions

}

}}}

Here, *New_Style* is the name for the new UI Style.

Save the file as *New_Style.php*.

*Note: It is very important that the class name for the style and the file name for the style are same; otherwise the style will not work.*

Next step is to tell the UI model about this new style. This is done by adding a new constant in UI.php file. This should be a string constant having value as the class name for the style. For the above example it will be like this:

{{{
constant NEW_STYLE = “New_Style”;
}}}

Now to use your new style just use the new constant as an argument to the constructor when creating a new instance of the UI class. This is done in the following way:

{{{
$myUI=new UI(UI::NEW_STYLE);
}}}
