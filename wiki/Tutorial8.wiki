#summary Data from two or mare tables using join()

= Introduction =
Read data from two or more tables.join() is defined as

join($join = null,$whereArr = null,$selectArr = null,$orderby = null,$limit = "",$count =false)

= Details =
Let's take two classes say  user and coach that extends to smartmodel.

Let's say our parent class would be User and field common to both the tables is user's id and coach's table's user_id

Example:

{{{
$user=new User();
$coach=new Coach();
$join = array("id"=>"coach.user_id");
$whereArr = array("status" => 'active',"coach.status"=>'active');
$req1 = $user->join($join,$whereArr);

}}}

So here,

$join is an array which takes the condition under which tables would be joined.

$whereArr is array to generate where condition.

similarly, if you want only some specific fields to be selected define
$selectArr=array('id','coach.name')

or for order we define $orderby=array('desc'=>'id')

Please Note:

Any field other than that of parent classes,should be suffixed with its respective class name


=Join more than 2 tables=

For this couple of case arises

case 1

say 3 classes are user,coach,team 

Now suppose we want to get details from all these 3 tables for a particular user's coach's team such that user id is joined at coach's user_id and coach id is joined at team's coach_id

so we will write

{{{
$user=new User();
$coach=new Coach();
$team=new Team();
$join = array("id"=>"coach.user_id","coach.id"=>"team.coach_id");
$req1 = $user->join($join);
}}}

case 2

This is a little modification in above condition.Now In case, these 3 tables are joined to user's id at coach's user_id and team's user_id as well.i.e both team and coach table are linked to user's id

so we will write

{{{
$user=new User();
$coach=new Coach();
$team=new Team();
$join = array("id"=>array("coach.user_id","team.user_id"));
$req1 = $user->join($join);
}}}
