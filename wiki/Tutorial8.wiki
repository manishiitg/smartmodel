#summary Join two or mare table using join()

= Introduction =
join() function is used to join two or more tables and fetch values using model 


= Details =
Let's take two classes say
user and coach that extends to smartmodel
so now we will join these tables associated with these two classes and fetch the values

join() is defined as

join($join = null,$whereArr = null,$selectArr = null,$orderby = null,$limit = "",$count =false)

Let's say our parent class would be User and field common to both the tables is user's id and coach's table's user_id

Example:

{{{
$user=new User();
$coach=new Coach();
$join = array("id"=>"coach.user_id");
$whereArr = array("status" => 'active',"coach.status"=>'active');
$req1 = $user->join($join,$whereArr);

}}}

So here,

$join is an array which takes the condition under which tables would be joined.
$whereArr is array to generate where condition.

Please Note:

Any field other than that of parent classes,should be suffixed with its respective class name
