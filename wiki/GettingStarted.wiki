= Project Setup =


These are the required file

Model.php
SmartModel.php
Validation.php
FileUtil.php
DataDB.php
config.inc.php

The file config.inc.php contains database access name, username and pass


{{{
	const host = 'localhost';
	const db = 'testdb';
	const user = "root";
	const pass = "root";
}}}

These four variables are required in config.inc.php

The file DataDB.php contains a method to connect to the database. 
This library used PHP PDO for database operation, but currently only support MYSQL connection.


If you want you can remove the config.inc.php file and supply the correct parameters to DataDB.php. Its very easy use another config as well, as per your project.

Model.php has $sql_tracking=true by default. You need to make it false in case you dont require debugging.

SmartModel.php and Validation.php also have $debug variable to turn debugging on/off
